# level-promise

  Promised LevelUp.

## Installation

    $ npm install level-promise

## Usage

  `LevelPromise(db)` (or `LevelPromise.install(db)`, if that suits your tastes) and you're off!
  Every method marked as async by level-manifest will now return a promise when you don't pass it a callback.
